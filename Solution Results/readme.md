# Solution Results
Here are the intended results of the assignment.
* "box*X*" are the rough estimate graphs to demonstrate the the probability volatility before smoothing with Naive Bayes.
* "predictions" corresponds to the estimate that the next item will be positive given all observations that have been seen.
* "bayes*X*" are the smooth estimates after applying the prior.

Note, since the Chi-Squared statistic was used, a perfect sample observation yields a P-value of 1. The Chi-Squared statistic for a perfect sample is 0 and its P-value is 1:
