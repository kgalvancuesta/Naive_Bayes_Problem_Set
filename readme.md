# Naive Bayes Project
Here is an original work I created as a Teaching Assistant for Advanced Econometrics, a graduate-level course in Data Science. You will find 
* the problem set I wrote for the students, 
* an outline that was given to aid students in completing the assignment, 
* the solution code, and 
* the intended results.  

The assignment was intended to be completed in Stata, but students submitted it in Python and R as well. It is now a part of Daniel Shoag's lecture series taught at both the Weatherhead School of Management and the Harvard Kennedy School.
